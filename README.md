# Return of the Notifier

It has been a dark time for
Notifier, but there is still
hope. A new era has arrived.
The previous Notifier major version
was controlled by Dart jQuery and
Vanilla JavaScript. In an attempt
to rescue Notifier, a few of
dotKom's people went together
and created a React App. This app
was fused with Notifier, giving
it strength and power one could
not even imagine was possible
in 2014...
